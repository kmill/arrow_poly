Did 0-5 crossings, arrow polynomials up to third cabling

(used 12 threads, implementation didn't do anything special with
planning composition beyond pre-computing cabled crossings)

With additional caching of writhe corrections, and also with a planner.

With a better planner, about the same amount of time (I was using the computer, too).
